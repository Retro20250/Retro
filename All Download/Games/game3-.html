    <p id="about">
        In Neighbours from Hell, the player take control of Woody, an average man who seeks revenge on his neighbour
        Mr.
        Rottweiler by performing tricks on him, all of which is secretly caught on camera for a reality TV show of
        the same
        name. In each level, the aim is to complete a set amount of pranks on Rottweiler, whilst keep out of sight
        of him; if
        Rottweiler spots and catches Woody, the level ends in failure and the player must restart it. The game
        itself sees
        players moving between various rooms in the house, such as the kitchen and hallway, via their doors, with
        levels grouped
        into "seasons"; as the player progresses to new seasons, the player gains access to more rooms with more
        challenging
        prank puzzles to complete.
