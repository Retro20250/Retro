        Plants vs. Zombies is a strategy defense game where the player protects their home from waves of zombies by
        placing different types of plants in a garden. The garden is divided into lanes, and zombies approach from the
        right side while the player places plants on the left to stop them. Each plant has a unique ability â€” some shoot
        projectiles, others block zombies, and some generate sunlight, which is the resource used to plant more
        defenses. The goal is to prevent the zombies from reaching the house by using smart placement and timing.
