        Counter-Strike is an objective-based, multiplayer tactical first-person shooter. Two opposing teams—the
        Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists—compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location
        to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages. At the end of each round, players are
        rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in
        subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing and completing objectives such as killing
        enemy players gives cash bonuses. Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, result in a penalty.
