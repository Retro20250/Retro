        The objective of Zuma is to eliminate all of the balls rolling around the screen along a given path (the
        path is clearly
        visible in each level except for the last one) with other balls before these balls reach the yellow skull
        structure,
        which will open to varying degrees as a warning of oncoming balls. The player can carry two balls at a time
        and can
        switch at any moment. As soon as one ball reaches the skull, the others follow, the stone frog idol spins
        around quickly
        and disappears and the player loses a life. To prevent the balls from reaching the skull, the player can
        eliminate the
        balls by firing a colored ball from the stone frog idol's mouth towards the chain of balls. When three or
        more of the
        same color come in contact, they explode, possibly triggering other explosions as part of a chain reaction.
        The chain of
        balls will continue to push forward until the player fills the yellow bar, which is when the balls will stop
        producing
        off-screen. The level is completed when the player eliminates all of the balls on the screen after the bar
        is filled.
