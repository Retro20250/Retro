        The main objective of the game is to pick up customers and take them to their chosen destination as quickly as
        possible. Along the way, money can be earned by performing stunts, such as near misses with other vehicles.The
        player is directed to a destination by a large green arrow at the top of the screen. The arrow does not adjust
        based on obstacles but rather points in the general direction of the destination. Once the player arrives near
        the destination, they must stop within a specified zone. When the destination is reached, the customer's fare is
        added to the player's total money earned. Ratings are then awarded depending on how long the player took to
        complete the journey. If the customer's timer runs out before the player reaches the destination, the customer
        will jump from the taxi without paying the driver.
