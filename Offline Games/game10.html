    <p id="about">
        in Feeding Frenzy, players control a hungry marine predator intent on munching as many other fish as
        possible. During the
        course of the game's 40 levels, they switch off between 5 marine animals, with the last eight levels
        having
        them play as
        Orville the Orca, and the last level being a 'boss battle' against the "Shark King", a great white
        shark.
        The player
        takes on the role of different aquatic species each trying to move up the food chain. As smaller fish
        are
        eaten, the
        player's own fish grows in size and becomes capable of eating somewhat larger fish. By the end of
        each
        level, the
        fish is sufficiently large enough that it can eat almost anything on-screen. Players must be vigilant
        for
        hazards which
        include depth charges, larger predators, naval mines, irradiated fish, and jellyfish.
